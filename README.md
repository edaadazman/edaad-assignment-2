KMeans Clustering Visualization Project

This project is a KMeans clustering visualization tool that allows users to explore different centroid initialization methods, including Random, Farthest First, KMeans++, and Manual. The tool provides dynamic visual feedback, enabling users to step through the clustering process or run it to convergence, while interacting with the data through a 2D plot.
